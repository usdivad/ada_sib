#Thoughts

You gotta put in the work of making those EWQL samples sound good!! dynamics and everything
Don't be hamfisted about it

Tempo changes / mood shifts to signal drama/action

The goal should be actual musical betterment not just "garnering Likes/publicity". Although that is a factor too
Be patient! Be a perfectionist man come on
Everything needs at least a week till "release"
Yes it'll take work, time, and effort; that's the whole idea
These pieces should actually be meaningful. Get advice from people
Inherently a little meaningless sure

Tell a story. You have to want it
You should be able to vary Ada's Theme in multiple ways. That's what it's all about
Have fun with them effects!
Don't be afraid of cues going on for too long. They're supposed to fit the drama. But you have to create musical drama haha

You should allow a day for individual gestation and advice from others, but only in the "Do you have a moment" vein not blast emails
Remember Solomon? "What's next? How can I be better"

Maybe actually lower ADa's Theme to 66bpm
Revising music is like debugging; there is a point where it *clicks* kind of, no?

Three Ruins
P.S. Meet Me at the Kentucky Derby

Analyze that Beethoven

Whoa the bars in the Sibelius and Live actually match! That's pretty damn cool

Is this a race? In some ways. I wanna beat T to the chase
Man I am vain. Embrace it!

#Story

There's a mockingbird in my hometown. Every winter, she flies to the South Pole to pick up droplets of sunlight for her children, traveling ritualistically across the Naragansett Shores. 

The heartbreak prevalent

She's in prison. Evey Thurman! 
Eve's Theme
Hero Returns to Asheville

She attends a protest gets arrested
Long march nomad (Citadels in the Wake of Ra)

This is the story of Ada, a girl who . Ada takes part in a student protest, gets arrested, and is sentenced to a traveling prison. On her journey across the desert she sees the spirits of a thousand cities. 

You need some happiness etc there too
Slightly dark
Don't pander though. Although I do love the pop. Keep unique voice. Keep listening to jazz etc.
Andriessen can be your bit of humor too; action/humor = andreeseen/horowitz
    - Action, horror, comedy
- D.A.S.H. (Doctor Andriessen Says Hello)


#Workflow:
- Piano sketch
- Sibelius score
- Live/EWQL program
    - opt revise Sibelius
    - Velocities!
- Live electronic effects and instrs and live overdubs
- Effects etc.


#EWQL TUTS:
http://www.soundsonline-forums.com/docs/EW-QL_Orchestra_Manual.pdf
You may want to make the last note 
of a Legato phrase Sustain instead, whenever it sounds as if that note is headed to a 
next note that never appears.

But be aware that achieveing a realistic legato line is not as easy as stringing together notes from a Legato patch; the effective use of expression, velocity, and selective attack accent can sometimes be needed to make the Legato samples come alive.
