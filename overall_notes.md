#Thoughts

You gotta put in the work of making those EWQL samples sound good!! dynamics and everything
Don't be hamfisted about it

Tempo changes / mood shifts to signal drama/action

The goal should be actual musical betterment not just "garnering Likes/publicity". Although that is a factor too
Be patient! Be a perfectionist man come on
Everything needs at least a week till "release"
Yes it'll take work, time, and effort; that's the whole idea
These pieces should actually be meaningful. Get advice from people
Inherently a little meaningless sure

Tell a story. You have to want it
You should be able to vary Ada's Theme in multiple ways. That's what it's all about
Have fun with them effects!
Don't be afraid of cues going on for too long. They're supposed to fit the drama. But you have to create musical drama haha

You should allow a day for individual gestation and advice from others, but only in the "Do you have a moment" vein not blast emails
Remember Solomon? "What's next? How can I be better"

Maybe actually lower ADa's Theme to 66bpm
Revising music is like debugging; there is a point where it *clicks* kind of, no?

Three Ruins
P.S. Meet Me at the Kentucky Derby

Analyze that Beethoven

Whoa the bars in the Sibelius and Live actually match! That's pretty damn cool

Is this a race? In some ways. I wanna beat T to the chase
Man I am vain. Embrace it!
Embrace the race to the chase

Figure out workflow esp on Sibelius. Just make sure it's always musical!!
Methodical 

There's no huge rush; it's all in your mind mind mind
Leave it all behind hind hind

The importance of dynamics!
Really just be patient w the sounds
Importing MIDI is good
Make sure it works 95%, not just "ok works 5%"

Maybe you can apply for some film/tv scoring "internship" type things. Once you build a portfolio
http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2013/12/19/breaking-bad-dave-porter-interview


Certain things e.g.:
- fiddling with note durations
- using velocity curves
- trying dif time signatures and section lengths and tempos till you figure the right one out
- contrasting sections
- limit self instrumentally to see what you can do without relying on "layering"
- testing pitch-shifts and effects for samples esp drums
- relative dynamics


Being happy with terrible code ignites the cynicism in other people and makes them want to strangle you as they tell you everything you could have done better. But hey, that means they're giving you advice!
And if you're really nice and humble towards that criticism and advice, they calm down and feel good enough that you're not a completely lost cause (or worse, a troll), and will happily help you further.
The combination of getting the frustrations at bad code out of their system, and having you be nice despite their rant towards you making them feel good about themselves, makes them associate giving you advice with feeling good.

#Ideas

54321:
- 54321: X----X---X--X-X
- 12345: X-XX--X---X----
- really trying to write a metal piece with classical instr?
- start with rubato drum stuff


Martyr:
- Main w/ brass melody in Em
- Main w/ string melody in Bm
- Back to Em melody
- electro

Go into 54321 groove but real softly over the dissonant part
and then 54321?

Let it BREATHE jeeeeez

do a massive attack type thing at the end, slight. and then the bat thing bombom
xxxxxxxx----

x---xxxxxxxxx-----------

transition needs dissonance


Mategory:
- there needs to be some space even in the frenziedness of it all
- and it has to be very purposeful
- end with a retrograde of the whole thing?
- you weren't methodical enough son


where's the action? it's pointless w/o structure imagined



Molecular:
- make sure you actually fiddle with own sounds; don't just use presets out of the box... don't rely on that


#Todo etc.
Remove:
bar 7 realism
bar 18 violin melody 16ths
25 the 1/4 bar always seems rushed
33 rushed violin sus

0:43 those triplets


percussion's gonna be harder than you thought
use snare instead

don't over do the "expressive" strings


Velocity maps
Tempo fluctuations
Microtiming (read up on Vijay?)


Martyr:
do a drum groove thing workout
import midi dir into live
string portamentos? scary
- beginning sounds empty, when the drums first come in
- reverb on tpt
- dialogue at end
- dynamics still; sometimes drums overpower

0:23 dynamic of viol
1:10 melody needs to stand out more
1:58 tpts need to be less robotic
2:30 violins the legato one is too synthy
same with snare at the end


tpt realism

horns too much in beginning
guitar pitch
string accelerando
no taiko in big part?
string realism in the 16ths...

BUILDERS
0:19 scene begins
0:36 home
0:42 arrive
0:54 create
1:06 staring
1:15 other workers
1:40 cowboy arrives
ytsejam nin



Wusi:
- fix the flute octave at beginning section
- piano last chord should be bigger, some higher notes

Molecular:
- should it get bigger?

Letter to Y:
- Bar 75 hold clarinet
- Realism still!
- Percussion dynamics between sections
- The beginning?

Velocity curves?
C vs F; chamber vs film?
blending the same instrument sample sounds; clarinet

clarinet chorus
drum velocity when back to verse




5/28:
1
0:30 violin entrance too much?
the "expressive violins" might be too much
the triplets still...
and the 16th notes
1:54 flute and violin exit


2.
0:14 snare roll too loud
0:23 that stray violin
are the strings drowning out the others? esp the percussion..
1:05 guitar fake..
nuances e.g. the spiderman strings are getting lost
2:06 robotic trumpets
2:25 robotic gets even worse; the trombone and fucking strings
2:40 the guitar upwards wants to go more


3.
experiment some more with settings

4.
clarinet still sounds shitty
cello strings around 1:51 robot
2:20 clarinet is so quiet


5.
overall mix is so quiet



you should truly know your pieces
every modulation, every orchestration
how to avoid roboticism?
    - gotta study the fucking manual
so overall EWQL doesn't do rhythmic stuff well

live performance james blake


rhythmic illusion via displacement:
- jai paul "all night"
- james blake "life round here"
- stewart copeland "spirits"
- ACDC "thunderstruck"?


probability of it being ringo?

Hey Professor Fussell,

I got your contact info from Daniel Bachrach, one of your students last summer; I'm friends with Daniel and we used to play in a band together. I was wondering if you're still available this summer (and beyond) for lessons of some sort?

A bit of background about myself: I'm a composer and drummer having just graduated from Columbia University with a degree in music and computer science. I studied computer music with Brad Garton and took composition seminars with Fred Lerdahl and Don Sickler. Some of my previous compositions:

- ... like kites with no strings (performed with Conrad Tao's SRIRACHA; I play drums here as well)
- Swan Dynasty (performed by counter)induction)
- One Eyed King (performed by LyricLion)
- Gold Mountain (performed by quartet at Banff)

Recently I have been writing more for the intention of film scoring, and I feel that a firmer grasp and deeper understanding of the musical palettes available will help me along that path, particularly in terms of setting, augmenting, and expressing the emotion and mood of a scene. Some "practice cues" that I have been working on can be found at the Ada Lovelace Project.

Among the things that I'd like to work on are:
- arranging and orchestration
- piano skills and technique
- harmonic and formal theory

Thank you so much for your time, and I hope to hear from you! Even if lessons don't work out, I would love to talk further with you about composition and music in general.

5/30

6:43 lyrics
11:00 runthru


and i had a dream so loud
that i found you in the rain
memories and doubt
will erase us yet again

and i try so hard
so hard to forgive
so i can move on
just so i can live



standards need to get higher
i'm not a good enough performer but these samples are too robotic; where's the middle ground?
at what point does human expression become undesirable inconsistency?


listenig with audio-technica headphones
1:
0:40 entrance is WAY too loud... compress?
0:58 lead string timing
balance strings horn etc, otherwise it sounds thin strangely
lead string swells at 1:55
snare 2:08 bad timing
2:30 why the double rolls so dumb
is this a good opening track even?

2:
cool strong entrance
0:15 snare change is maybe not subtle
0:25 the stray string
0:30 the additional strings are maybe too much now.. come in later
all the percussion ins in left channel
that guitar squeal is goood
1:58 one of the trombone? tuba? has a weird decay. with the timpani
trumpet.....
and yeah roboticism around 2:27 etc.
snare gets overshadowed around 2:50

3:
end cuts off oops

4:
clarinet melody never feels
clipping in 1:05
1:31 robotic perc..
1:47 robotic cello


5:
louder overall
piano dynamics?

6:
a more bare bit after what's transpired



2:
right ear drums are a bit too obtuse in the first section

this demo issue?

#Story

There's a mockingbird in my hometown. Every winter, she flies to the South Pole to pick up droplets of sunlight for her children, traveling ritualistically across the Naragansett Shores. 

The heartbreak prevalent

She's in prison. Evey Thurman! 
Eve's Theme
Hero Returns to Asheville

She attends a protest gets arrested
Long march nomad (Citadels in the Wake of Ra)

This is the story of Ada, a girl who . Ada takes part in a student protest, gets arrested, and is sentenced to a traveling prison. On her journey across the desert she sees the spirits of a thousand cities. 

You need some happiness etc there too
Slightly dark
Don't pander though. Although I do love the pop. Keep unique voice. Keep listening to jazz etc.
Andriessen can be your bit of humor too; action/humor = andreeseen/horowitz
    - Action, horror, comedy
- D.A.S.H. (Doctor Andriessen Says Hello)


#Workflow:
- Piano sketch
- Sibelius score
- Live/EWQL program
    - opt revise Sibelius
    - Velocities!
- Live electronic effects and instrs and live overdubs
- Effects etc.


#EWQL TUTS:
http://www.soundsonline-forums.com/docs/EW-QL_Orchestra_Manual.pdf
You may want to make the last note 
of a Legato phrase Sustain instead, whenever it sounds as if that note is headed to a 
next note that never appears.

But be aware that achieveing a realistic legato line is not as easy as stringing together notes from a Legato patch; the effective use of expression, velocity, and selective attack accent can sometimes be needed to make the Legato samples come alive.
