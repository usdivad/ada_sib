#Thoughts

You gotta put in the work of making those EWQL samples sound good!! dynamics and everything
Don't be hamfisted about it

Tempo changes / mood shifts to signal drama/action

The goal should be actual musical betterment not just "garnering Likes/publicity". Although that is a factor too
Be patient! Be a perfectionist man come on
Everything needs at least a week till "release"
Yes it'll take work, time, and effort; that's the whole idea
These pieces should actually be meaningful. Get advice from people
Inherently a little meaningless sure

Tell a story. You have to want it
You should be able to vary Ada's Theme in multiple ways. That's what it's all about
Have fun with them effects!
Don't be afraid of cues going on for too long. They're supposed to fit the drama. But you have to create musical drama haha

You should allow a day for individual gestation and advice from others, but only in the "Do you have a moment" vein not blast emails
Remember Solomon? "What's next? How can I be better"

Maybe actually lower ADa's Theme to 66bpm
Revising music is like debugging; there is a point where it *clicks* kind of, no?

Three Ruins
P.S. Meet Me at the Kentucky Derby

Analyze that Beethoven

Whoa the bars in the Sibelius and Live actually match! That's pretty damn cool

Is this a race? In some ways. I wanna beat T to the chase
Man I am vain. Embrace it!
Embrace the race to the chase

Figure out workflow esp on Sibelius. Just make sure it's always musical!!
Methodical 

There's no huge rush; it's all in your mind mind mind
Leave it all behind hind hind

The importance of dynamics!
Really just be patient w the sounds
Importing MIDI is good
Make sure it works 95%, not just "ok works 5%"

Maybe you can apply for some film/tv scoring "internship" type things. Once you build a portfolio

#Ideas

54321:
- 54321: X----X---X--X-X
- 12345: X-XX--X---X----
- really trying to write a metal piece with classical instr?
- start with rubato drum stuff


Martyr:
- Main w/ brass melody in Em
- Main w/ string melody in Bm
- Back to Em melody
- electro

Go into 54321 groove but real softly over the dissonant part
and then 54321?

Let it BREATHE jeeeeez

do a massive attack type thing at the end, slight. and then the bat thing bombom
xxxxxxxx----

x---xxxxxxxxx-----------

transition needs dissonance


Mategory:
- there needs to be some space even in the frenziedness of it all
- and it has to be very purposeful
- end with a retrograde of the whole thing?
- you weren't methodical enough son


where's the action? it's pointless w/o structure imagined



Molecular:
- make sure you actually fiddle with own sounds; don't just use presets out of the box... don't rely on that


#Todo etc.
Remove:
bar 7 realism
bar 18 violin melody 16ths
25 the 1/4 bar always seems rushed
33 rushed violin sus

0:43 those triplets


percussion's gonna be harder than you thought


Velocity maps
Tempo fluctuations
Microtiming (read up on Vijay?)


Martyr:
do a drum groove thing workout
import midi dir into live
string portamentos? scary
- beginning sounds empty, when the drums first come in
- reverb on tpt
- dialogue at end
- dynamics still; sometimes drums overpower

0:23 dynamic of viol
1:10 melody needs to stand out more
1:58 tpts need to be less robotic
2:30 violins the legato one is too synthy
same with snare at the end


Wusi:
- fix the flute octave at beginning section
- piano last chord should be bigger, some higher notes

Molecular:
- should it get bigger?

#Story

There's a mockingbird in my hometown. Every winter, she flies to the South Pole to pick up droplets of sunlight for her children, traveling ritualistically across the Naragansett Shores. 

The heartbreak prevalent

She's in prison. Evey Thurman! 
Eve's Theme
Hero Returns to Asheville

She attends a protest gets arrested
Long march nomad (Citadels in the Wake of Ra)

This is the story of Ada, a girl who . Ada takes part in a student protest, gets arrested, and is sentenced to a traveling prison. On her journey across the desert she sees the spirits of a thousand cities. 

You need some happiness etc there too
Slightly dark
Don't pander though. Although I do love the pop. Keep unique voice. Keep listening to jazz etc.
Andriessen can be your bit of humor too; action/humor = andreeseen/horowitz
    - Action, horror, comedy
- D.A.S.H. (Doctor Andriessen Says Hello)


#Workflow:
- Piano sketch
- Sibelius score
- Live/EWQL program
    - opt revise Sibelius
    - Velocities!
- Live electronic effects and instrs and live overdubs
- Effects etc.


#EWQL TUTS:
http://www.soundsonline-forums.com/docs/EW-QL_Orchestra_Manual.pdf
You may want to make the last note 
of a Legato phrase Sustain instead, whenever it sounds as if that note is headed to a 
next note that never appears.

But be aware that achieveing a realistic legato line is not as easy as stringing together notes from a Legato patch; the effective use of expression, velocity, and selective attack accent can sometimes be needed to make the Legato samples come alive.
